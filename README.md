# telegram-bots

This is a collection repo for different telegram bots I've created.
The repo has the following bots:
* `first_gnkl_bot`: generic simple bot that performs random string tasks 
* `schedule_word_bot`: this bot is practice for playing with jobs in telegram bots
* `daily_wisdom_bot`: this bot is the first full usable product. The bot provides different series of books, split in chunks. The user can set up a daily time to receive a chunk of the story and continue reading. It's focused mostly on reading one chapter per day and pacing the studying, without skipping the reading though. The book collection contains the database for the messages the user receives each day. More todos: (add markdown parsing, fetch next, better exception handling, etc.)
